## Development Notes
#### Tehnologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Grid and Flexbox, Tailwind)
- JS

#### Layout
Throughout this project, we will strive to use Tailwind and DaisyUI components. This is to minimize clutter in the CSS file and make the project more readable. 

We start by creating a vertical sidebar with collapsible menu items. The sidebar should be responsive and collapse on mobile views. 

We use Flexbox and Grid to position the main layout. We start from the outermost layout and go inward using nested flexbox and grid.
